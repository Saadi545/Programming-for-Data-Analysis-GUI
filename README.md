Data Analysis and Machine Learning Application: Report
1. Introduction
Project Overview and Objectives
This project focuses on developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive data analysis and machine learning prediction. The main objective is to provide users with a user-friendly platform to load datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize data, and predict results using a trained machine learning model. By integrating data handling, visualization, and predictive modeling, the application serves as a complete solution for novice and expert users alike.

Brief on Tasks and Their Purpose
The project is divided into the following tasks:

Data Handling: Loading and merging datasets for further analysis.
EDA: Understanding data through statistical summaries and visualizations.
Model Building: Developing and training a machine learning model for prediction.
Application Development: Designing an interactive GUI with functionality for all tasks.
Version Control: Managing the development process with Git for tracking changes.
2. Task 1: Data Handling
Data Collection
Source: The data was provided as sample records from an air quality monitoring dataset. It contains information on pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and weather metrics such as temperature, pressure, and wind speed.
Description: Each record includes:
Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3.
Weather Metrics: TEMP, PRES, DEWP, RAIN, wind direction (wd), and wind speed (WSPM).
Location and Time: Year, month, day, hour, and station.
Data Import and Merge
Tools:
pandas for data handling.
tkinter for file import functionality.
Process:
Data was loaded into the application via a file dialog or sample string input.
The data was checked for completeness, structure, and potential merge issues.
Summary: The dataset contained hourly records, with over 20 attributes describing pollution levels and weather conditions.
3. Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Understanding
Summary:
Rows: 18.
Columns: 18.
Data Types: Mix of numeric (e.g., PM2.5) and categorical (e.g., wind direction).
Missing Values: The dataset was mostly complete; missing values were not observed in the provided sample.
Data Preprocessing
Steps:
Checked for missing values.
Verified data types and converted them where necessary.
Ensured data was consistent and free of duplicates.
Engineered features like pollutant averages for future analysis.
Analysis and Visualization
Statistical Insights:
Average PM2.5 values were higher during early hours.
Temperature and wind speed varied significantly with time and weather conditions.
Visualizations:
Histograms for pollutant distributions.
Count plots for categorical variables like wind direction.
Line plots for trends over time.
4. Task 3: Model Building
Model Selection and Preprocessing
Model: Linear Regression was selected due to its simplicity and interpretability.
Preprocessing:
Features: Hour, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, TEMP, PRES.
Target: PM2.5.
Data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Scaling and encoding were not required as features were already numeric.
Training, Testing, and Parameter Tuning
Training:
The model was trained on the training set using scikit-learn.
Testing:
Predictions were made on the testing set.
Performance Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.36.
RÂ² Score: 0.89.
Results:
The model demonstrated good accuracy in predicting PM2.5 levels, suitable for decision-making in air quality monitoring.

5. Task 4: Application Development
Overview of the GUI Application
The application was built using tkinter and integrated functionality for loading data, performing EDA, and generating predictions.

Features:
